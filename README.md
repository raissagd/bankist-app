# Real life bank app, using vanilla JavaScript
![screenshot from the website](https://github.com/raissagd/bankist-app/blob/main/screenshot.PNG)

This project was coded along two *long* sections of the "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" course, by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.

## Attention! ðŸš¨
The app has some built in users, and you need their username and password to access it<br>
So, if you want to check the website  out, try logging in with the **username 'js'** (that stands for Jonas Schmedtmann) and the password '1111'.<br>
Besides, **if you'd like to try transfering money for some user**, try 'jd' (Jessica Davis).

## You can access the full deployed app [here](https://raissagd.github.io/bankist-app/)!

Obs: the timeout function was not implemented.
